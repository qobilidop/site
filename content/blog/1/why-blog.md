Recently I've finally made up my mind to seriously pursue a career in software engineering.

I've enjoyed coding for a long time. Coding is the one thing that I kept coming back to no matter what other things I was doing. I have considered having a career in software engineering, but I wasn't serious enough that I took another major and thought I could switch to be a professional software engineer whenever I want, which proves to be a really difficult path. I am responsible for my past decisions. And now, I have to work harder to switch to the career path I would like to be in.

At this stage, I think it's beneficial to start a blog. It's widely suggested that software engineers or developers have a blog as a place to learn, share, and self-market. I would like to use it to motivate myself. Also, writing is a skill worth improving in general.

And here begins my journey.
