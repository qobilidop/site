Finally, I've set up a decent personal website with a blog.

This website is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), the most popular JavaScript static site generator. There are many static site generators in other languages. I choose the JavaScript one because I'd like to learn some front-end technologies along the way.

I plan to use this blog mainly to practice technical writing. I hope to share something fun or useful. But there is no guarantee that I'll focus on anything.
