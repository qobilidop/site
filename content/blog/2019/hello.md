Finally I've made my personal site and blog. Let me talk about the tech stack adopted, and the rationales behind it as the first post.

When I started thinking about creating my personal website, one thing was certain, I want it to be static. I made the first version of my personal website in hand-written html. It was a good exercise, but gradually I've come to realize the limitation and tediousness of this approch. So I started looking for a static site generator. There are a lot of options out there as listed on [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/). One option immediately jumps to my eye: Gatsby.

I've long been wanting to learn some frontend technologies, and I know that in frontend (at least for now), JavaScript is everything. A static site is essentially a frontend work. So why not taking this chance to familiarize myself with some of the trending frontend technologies? And Gatsby is exactly that option.

It does take me a fair amount of time to learn all the basics from HTNL, CSS, Javascript, all the way up to React, and Gatsby. It looks like a lot, especially when listed like this. But to give you a more realistic impression, I didn't learn them linearly in this order, but started with Gatsby's tutorial and learn a little bit of everything from practice.
