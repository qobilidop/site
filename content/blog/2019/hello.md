Finally, I have a decent personal website set up. It is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), the most popular JavaScript static site generator. I chose it mainly because I wanted to learn some front-end technologies along the way, which means I was looking for JavaScript-based technologies.

I'm not sure what would be in this blog, most likely some programming stuff. I'll figure that out later. Hopefully, there will be some fun. But before anything else, let's greet the world as usual!
