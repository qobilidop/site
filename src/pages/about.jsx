      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Bili Dong, an aspiring software engineer.</p>
      <p>I have solid skills in Python, especially the scientific computing and data science aspects. I'm familiar with the Python development toolchain from linting, testing, documentation, packaging, to releasing. I'm comfortable with C/C++. I'm learning JavaScript and improving my web development skills in general. Besides what's mentioned, I'm always willing to learn new things and explore new directions.</p>
      <p>Currently, I'm a graduate student doing computational astrophysics research. At the same time, I'm improving my computer science knowledge and engineering skills to prepare for a future career in software engineering. During graduate school, I got involved in some open-source software projects. With the help of the community, I have trained myself to be a research software engineer. These experiences are the main driver for me to aspire to be a professional software engineer. Most importantly, I find myself most passionate and productive while developing software.</p>
      <p>I'm currently looking for internship opportunities. If you are interested to hire me, here is my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vIo44lI0uNNDTmiO8F5AP7d0HQ3nEMac">resume</a>. You could also find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/qobilidop/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
